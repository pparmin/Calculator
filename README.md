# Calculator

Link: https://pparmin.github.io/Calculator/

### Features

The calculator allows you to perform all basic arithmetic operations, including: 

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Division
- Multiplication

Additionally, you can insert a decimal point and convert the number from negative to positive and/or vice versa. 

### Future Updates

Full keyboard support is planned for the future.

### Learning Outcome

The calculator project had a slightly bigger scope than the Etch-A-Sketch. I could definitely make use of what I had learned previously with the Etch-A-Sketch project. Especially making all the functions work in the correct order without messing up the saved values and the textscreen was a challenge.
